The eXokernel Development Kit is an open source effort to build exokernel capabilities for the Linux operating system.

The project was founded on code developed and released by Samsung Research America, Silicon Valley in 2014.

History:
--------

29-09-2015:

Re-write of PCI configuration space access via PK module.  PCI memory
mapped resources still through /sys/bus/pci filesystem - this could be improved
by putting into pkXXX node.  Still need to secure access to other pkXXX/xyz
elements by verifying the device has been granted to the caller.

29-01-2015:

Initial version of NVMe SSD driver works on both QEMU and Samsung SSD
XS1715 hardware.

20-11-2014:

The AHCI test driver now operates without root permissions.  This is
quite a milestone since running device drivers as non-priviledged 
processes is a cornerstone of the exokernel concept.  Root permission
is needed to load the kernel module and also to "grant" permissions
to a user (uid) for a specific device. See tools/devgrant/

12-11-2014:  

XDK seed code released as open source.  At this point much of
the code is not fully operational and requires significant attention.  The
basic Exokernel is operational and the AHCI block device driver can be 
used to demonstrate its capability.
